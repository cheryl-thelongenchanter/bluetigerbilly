# This is my firs github repository and I am using it for CIS20231N1 Linux, Professor Gilson.
# This repo contains one script that prints 1 to 50 to standard output.

# count50.sh

# The script uses a for loop to iterate a generated sequence on numbers from
# "1" to "50" and prints to the standard output. The script exits once it 
# reaches the end of the sequence which is "50"

# To run the script, enter ./count50.sh
